  <h2>My Story</h2>
  <p>I am from Santa Barbara originally and graduated from Santa Barbara High School. I got interested in environmental science as a kid when I used to go to earth day every year and learn about the world. I also enjoyed the many great places to be outdoors in the area and in other parts of California. My favorite thing about Santa Barbara are the sunsets from Sands Beach in the winter.</p>
