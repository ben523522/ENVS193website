    "text": "My Story\n\n\nI grew up in Santa Barbara and graduated from SB High School. My interest in environmental science started with our local Earth Day events, where I loved learning about nature. Living here also gave me plenty of time outdoors—hiking, beach trips, and watching winter sunsets at Sands Beach. Those experiences made me want to study and protect California’s environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterests\n\n\nI love to explore outdoors, especially with friends. Hiking and biking to skiing and swimming - I enjoy it all.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCooking\n\n\nOne of my favorite pastimes is making BBQ on the grill outside my student housing. From tacos to ribs to steaks - I grill it all!"
